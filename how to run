## 🔧 How to Run the Project

This project detects fire using a webcam feed with a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and HSV-based flame masking.

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Webcam (built-in or USB)
- PyCharm (optional but recommended)
- `best.pt` YOLOv8 trained model (place in project folder)

### 📦 Install Required Python Packages

Open a terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```

### ▶️ Running the Script

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fire-detection-yolov8-webcam.git
   cd fire-detection-yolov8-webcam
   ```

2. Make sure the file `best.pt` is in this project folder.

3. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python fire_detect.py
   ```

   Or, if using **PyCharm**:
   - Open the folder as a project
   - Right-click `fire_detect.py` > Run

### 🧪 Notes

- Press `q` to close the webcam window.
- "FIRE DETECTED!" will appear in the frame if fire is found.
- This system combines:
  - YOLOv8 detection from `best.pt`
  - HSV flame color masking
  - Flicker-based logic for added accuracy

Make sure to test under different lighting conditions for better robustness.
